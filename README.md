# Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Calculator
I developed this Visual Basic program for my Graphical User Interface Programming (GUIPROG) class at Asia Pacific College. Our professor tasked us to make a program using Visual Basic that primarily uses checkboxes as a means of selection rather than radiobuttons.

## Flaws
While I tried to be as accurate as possible in the calculation of the tuition for an undergraduate year at Harvard, the data and the means of computation in here is *extremely* inaccurate. Although I tried to gather as much data as I can to be as accurate as possible with the calculation of the tuition, there are no places online that posts the actual tuition of a year at Harvard for an undergraduate (as it obviously varies from person to person). As a result, I had to rely on various articles and websites telling me how much a class costs, and other small stuff. So, yeah, the data in here is extremely inaccurate, you've been warned.

Another flaw is found at the `Houses at Harvard` section. In that page, there are 10 checkboxes, but you may only select 1 house to reside in. I do admit that I could've done better if I had used radiobuttons on this page rather than checkboxes, but our professor required a program with 30 checkboxes, so I had to fit the bill on that one.
